## FLUX React JS Boilerplate

Quickstart project template for building `npm` modules with [React JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for lazy loading & code splitting.

Based on the architecture suggestions from Facebook, this boilerplate will help you deal with it. Read more about FLUX over at [Facebook Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/)

Just `npm install` and `npm run deploy` when you're done. Use `npm start` to continuously build.
